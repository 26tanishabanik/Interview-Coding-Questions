'''
Given a connected and undirected graph, a spanning tree of that graph is a subgraph that is a tree and connects all 
the vertices together. A single graph can have many different spanning trees. A minimum spanning tree (MST) or 
minimum weight spanning tree for a weighted, connected, undirected graph is a spanning tree with a weight less than 
or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree. The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of weights given to each edge of the spanning tree.
How many edges does a minimum spanning tree has? 
A minimum spanning tree has (V â€“ 1) edges where V is the number of vertices in the given graph.
