"""
Given two strings str1 and str2, the task is to find the length of the shortest string that has both str1 and str2 as subsequences.

Examples : 

Input:   str1 = "geek",  str2 = "eke"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
String "geeke" has both string "geek" 
and "eke" as subsequences.

Input:   str1 = "AGGTAB",  str2 = "GXTXAYB"
Output:  9
Explanation: 
String "AGXGTXAYB" has both string 
"AGGTAB" and "GXTXAYB" as subsequences.
