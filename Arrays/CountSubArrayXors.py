Given an array of integers arr[] and a number m, count the number of subarrays having XOR of their elements as m.
Examples: 

Input : arr[] = {4, 2, 2, 6, 4}, m = 6
Output : 4
Explanation : The subarrays having XOR of 
              their elements as 6 are {4, 2}, 
              {4, 2, 2, 6, 4}, {2, 2, 6},
               and {6}
